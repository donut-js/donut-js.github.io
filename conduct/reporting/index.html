<h1>Donut.js Reporting Guidelines</h1>

<p>If you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of the <a href="https://donutjs.club/conduct/">Donut.js Code of Conduct</a>, even if they seem inconsequential, please report it as soon as possible. You can contact us through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online form: <a href="https://donutjs.club/cocform">donutjs.club/cocform</a></li>
  <li>Email: <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x63;&#x6f;&#99;&#x40;&#x64;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#117;&#116;&#106;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#108;&#117;&#x62;">&#99;&#111;&#x63;&#x40;&#x64;&#x6f;&#110;&#x75;&#x74;&#106;&#115;&#46;&#x63;&#108;&#x75;&#x62;</a></li>
  <li>Text/SMS: <a href="sms:5034798885">(503) 479-8885</a></li>
  <li>In person: speak to the designated Code of Conduct responder at Donut.js events</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All reports will be kept confidential.</strong> In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that&#8217;s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.</p>

<p>If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to contact, include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.</p>

<p>In your report, please include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.</li>
  <li>If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.</li>
  <li>When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.</li>
  <li>Your account of what occurred.</li>
  <li>If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a tweet or mailing list) please include a link.</li>
  <li>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</li>
  <li>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>
  <li>Your contact info for follow-up contact</li>
  <li>Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-you-file-a-report">What happens after you file a report?</h2>

<p>You will receive a response from Donut.js acknowledging receipt as soon as possible, but within 2 business days.</p>

<p>Donut.js Code of Conduct responders will review the incident and determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happened.</li>
  <li>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.</li>
  <li>What kind of response is appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the team&#8217;s immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an &#8220;official&#8221; response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.</p>

<p>Once the team has a complete account of the events, we will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nothing (if we determine no code of conduct violation occurred).</li>
  <li>A private reprimand from the Code of Conduct response team to the individual(s) involved.</li>
  <li>A public reprimand.</li>
  <li>An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to &#8220;take a week off&#8221; from a mailing list or chat room).</li>
  <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Donut.js spaces (events, meetings, mailing lists, chat rooms, etc.)</li>
  <li>A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#8217;ll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an update on the situation. Reporter feedback may be factored into our next steps, with the final action determined by the Donut.js Code of Conduct responders.</p>

<p>The response team will make a summary report of the situation to the Donut.js lead organizers. The organizers may choose to issue a public report of the incident or take additional actions.</p>

<h2 id="appealing-the-response">Appealing the response</h2>

<p>Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the working group, contact the Donut.js Code of Conduct response team at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x63;&#x40;&#x64;&#x6f;&#110;&#x75;&#x74;&#106;&#x73;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6c;&#117;&#x62;">&#99;&#111;&#x63;&#x40;&#100;&#111;&#x6e;&#x75;&#116;&#106;&#x73;&#46;&#99;&#108;&#x75;&#x62;</a> with your appeal and Donut.js lead organizers and Code of Conduct response team will review the case together.</p>
